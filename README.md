# Advanced Internet Programming 2018_Assignmemt 3_The Golden Time Cinema Project

This is a repository that provides the deliverable for assignment 3 for our group Web Three(two nerds now becuase one teammate dropped the subject). 

## Principles of code style 
	Code style:
	
	• Write meaningful variable names;
	
	• Write meaningful comments;
	
	• Make consistent indentation and space for the code;
	
	• Write consistent naming convention, meaning we use pascal case for naming property, methods and class names and
	  camel case for variables and methods' parameters;
	  
	• Propoerly use nested loops and do not wirte long nested loops;
	
	• Do not repete the same logic to avoid duplicated code. Follow KISS priciple: keep it simple and stupid; 
	
	• Refactor the code after it works and try to make it clean to realise the same fucntion so that the code is more  	     readable;
	
	• Do not write long methods, one method for one purpose;
	
	• Write good unit testing and it covers all the core functions;
	
	Design:
	
	• Design a clear structure for the project, 

	• Seperate layers at least for business, data and presentation with three or more layers but less than five; 

	• Consider the resusability of code;

	• Make good database design with necessary attributes and data type. Eliminate redundant data.
	
	• Set up proper authentication and athorisation for the security of the project, which inceases its reliability;

	• Consider modularity by dividing modules that serve different purposes to deal with the grow of the poeject. 

## Use guide

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
