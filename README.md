## Build With (The MEAN Stack)

• [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Document database, used by Back-end application to store data as JSON documents

• [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Back-end web application Framework running on top of Node.js

• [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Front-end web application Framework

• [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime environment

## Getting Started

### Pre-Requisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following pre-requisites on your development machine:

• Git - [Download & install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.

• Node.js - [Download & install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

• MongoDB - [Download & install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?initial=true), and make sure it runs on the default port (27017).

### Installation

• Clone this repository into a specified folder on your local machine

• Run `npm install` in the root folder of your local repository to install dependencies for back-end development

• `cd .\GoldenTimeCinema-angular\` to change directory to front-end directory of Angular

• Run `npm install` to install dependencies for front-end development

• To update these packages of dependencies, run `npm update` in the either directories as specified above

### Running The Application

• Run Mongo daemon `mongod` in one terminal to start the Mongo server

• Run Mongo shell `mongod` in another terminal to access data in MongoDB

• `cd .\GoldenTimeCinema-angular\` to change directory to front-end directory of Angular

• Run `ng build` to build the front-end project in Angular project folder

• Navigate to the project root

• Run `nodemon start` in the project root to start the application

• The application should run on port 3000 with the development environment configuration, so in your browser just go to http://localhost:3000

## Principles of code style

    Code style:

    • Write meaningful variable names;

    • Write meaningful comments;

    • Make consistent indentation and space for the code;

    • Write consistent naming convention, meaning we use pascal case for naming property, methods and class names and
      camel case for variables and methods' parameters;

    • Properly use nested loops and do not wirte long nested loops;

    • Do not repeat the same logic to avoid duplicated code. Follow KISS priciple: keep it simple and stupid;

    • Refactor the code after it works and try to make it clean to realise the same fucntion so that the code is more readable;

    • Do not write long methods, one method for one purpose;

    • Write good unit testing and it covers all the core functions;

    Design:

    • Design a clear structure for the project,

    • Seperate layers at least for business, data and presentation with three or more layers but less than five;

    • Consider the resusability of code;

    • Make good database design with necessary attributes and data type. Eliminate redundant data.

    • Set up proper authentication and athorisation for the security of the project, which inceases its reliability;

    • Consider modularity by dividing modules that serve different purposes to deal with the grow of the project.
