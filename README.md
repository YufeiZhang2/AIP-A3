## Priciples of code style 

	• Write meaningful variable names;
	• Write meaningful comments;
	• Write Consistent naming convention, meaning we use pascal case for naming property, methods and class names and camel case         for variables and methods' parameters;
	• Propoerly use nested loops and do not wirte long nested loops;
	• Do not repete the same logic.  Follow KISS priciple: keep it simple and stupid;
	• Refactor the code after it works and try to make it clean to realise the same fucntion so that the code is more readable;
